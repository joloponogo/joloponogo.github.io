# Plan your Plants
## Description
### About
**Plan your Plants** is a small project of mine to help you choose a combination of plants that benefit, or at least don't hinder, eachother for your vegetable patches.
### How to Use
You just pick the plant that you definately want in your patch, and then click on **add one more**. you get a list of plants that **benefit** your target plant, and a list of plants that act **neutral** towards your target plant.
## Sources
### Plant Knowledge
I have all my information from various online and offline sources. Unfortunately, these often differ from one another, so I try to make informed guesses as to which information is more believable than the other.
### Code
The code was done by me alone, so there may be bugs or room for improvement.
